    Based on the following user preferences, recommend 4 movies:

    Please provide the recommendations in a markdown table format with the following columns:
    | Movie | Genre | Short Summary | IMDB Score |

    Each short summary should be concise, not exceeding 30 words. The IMDB Score should be a number between 1 and 10.
    Include the year of the movie in parentheses next to the movie title.

    After the table, provide for each recommendation:
    1. A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for why it was recommended.
    2. An interesting trivia fact about the movie, prefixed with "Did you know:"

    Example format:
    | Movie | Genre | Short Summary | IMDB Score |
    |-------|-------|---------------|------------|
    | Inception (2010) | Sci-Fi | A thief enters dreams to plant ideas. | 8.8 |

    1. Inception (2010): Recommended for its mind-bending plot and stunning visuals, which align with your interest in sci-fi.
       \nðŸŽ¬ Did you know: The spinning top at the end of Inception was not actually Leonardo DiCaprio's totem - it was his wedding ring.
